###Plotting Time Series

![Time Series Plots](https://github.com/dandermotj/TimeSeriesAnalysis/blob/master/Labs/Lab%201/TimeSeriesPlots.png)

The Lab 1 folder contains a script that will import a dataset of time series, do some processing and render ggplot plots with Tufte's theme and then arranges them in a nice grid.

The purpose of this exercise was to plot some time series and then identify the general characteristics of each one. For example, it is clear from the plot that series 1 - 4 are stationary with constant means and variances, while the 5th and 6th series do not have constant means as well as containing a drift term; one positive drift and the other with negative drift.
